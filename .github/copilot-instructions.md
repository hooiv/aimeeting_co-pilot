This is a MERN stack project for a real-time AI meeting co-pilot. Prioritize code that demonstrates:
- Real-time audio streaming (WebRTC/WebSockets)
- Integration with GenAI APIs for STT, TTS, and RAG
- Contextual prompt suggestions in the UI
- REST API backend (Node.js/Express)
- PostgreSQL and vector database integration
- Dockerized setup
- Basic authentication (Firebase or Supabase)
- Modern React frontend with chat/meeting UI
- Example of web search and CRM update action
- Low latency and responsiveness
- Use p5.js for creative/visual frontend components (e.g., real-time audio waveform, participant activity, or AI insights visualization)
